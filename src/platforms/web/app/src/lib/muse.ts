// Muse (dataset-wide garden, curate, roll) — the web app's front end onto the muse
// engine in `src/crystal/muse`. That module lives outside this app's own
// `tsconfig.json` `include` (see the note on `DatasetMediaItem` in `./api.ts`), but a
// direct relative import resolves fine through this app's own `tsc --noEmit` and
// `vite build` — verified before this file existed. Nothing below reimplements
// garden/roll/sampler/weaver logic; it is a thin, pure composition layer over it, so
// there is exactly one copy of that logic in the tree.
